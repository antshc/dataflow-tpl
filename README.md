# Dataflow areas of using
## Sensor data processing
Let's consider a scenario where you have a stream of sensor data coming from multiple devices, and you need to process and analyze this data in real-time. 
Dataflow can be a great fit for building such a data processing pipeline. 
## Web crawler
A simple web crawler that fetches and processes web pages concurrently.
## Image Processing Pipeline
Suppose you have a requirement to process a batch of images asynchronously, applying multiple filters and transformations to each image. 
You can use Dataflow to create a pipeline for this task efficiently.
## Real-time Data Processing Pipeline
Let's say you have a real-time data processing requirement where you receive a continuous stream of data from various sources, and you need to process this data concurrently and efficiently. 
Dataflow can be a good fit for building such pipelines.
